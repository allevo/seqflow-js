This is the tutorial for the Seqflow framework. It is a step-by-step guide to create a simple application that fetches a random quote from an API and displays it.

The tutorial covers the following topics:
- [the step 0](/getting-started/prerequisites): how to create a new Seqflow application.
- [the step 1](/getting-started/fetch-data): how to fetch data from an API and manage the state of the application.
- [the step 2](/getting-started/split-components): how to create a new component.
- [the step 3](/getting-started/configuration): how to configure the application.
- [the step 4](/getting-started/test): How to test the application.

But let's start from the beginning.

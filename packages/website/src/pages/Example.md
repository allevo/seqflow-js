In this page, we list the official examples in the main repository. Feel free to ask more, creating an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/allevo/seqflow-js/pulls">Issue or a Pull Request</a> example.

## Random quote

This examples is a good starting point to understand how SeqFlow works: it fetches a random quote from an API and shows it in the application. The user can click on the button to fetch a new quote.

The Get Started tutorial is built on top of this example. The tutorial is available <a target="_blank" href="/getting-started">here</a>. The final code is available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/allevo/seqflow-js/tree/main/examples/random-quote">here</a>.

In the tutorial, you will learn how to:
- create a new SeqFlow application
- create components
- split your logic into domains
- handle events
- perform async operation like data fetching from an HTTP API

## Counter

Even if we don't believe that no one will create a Counter application for production, it is a common example of other frameworks. This project shows a simple counter that can be incremented or decremented. There is also a form to set the counter to a specific value.

This is a good example to start with SeqFlow, showing how you can structure an application into domains and how the application handles events.

The code is available <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/allevo/seqflow-js/tree/main/examples/counter">here</a>.


## E-Commerce

This is a complex example where multiple domains interact each other. In this example, a simple e-commerce website shows a list of products, the user can log in and add/remove products to/from the cart and can also place an order.
In this example, there's also a simple router that handles the navigation between the pages.

## Counter with custom element

SeqFlow supports custom elements and it is easy to build a custom element from existing applications.
This example shows how to create a custom element using SeqFlow.

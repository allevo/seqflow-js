We’re thrilled to announce the release of SeqFlow version 1.0.0-rc1! After months of development, testing, and fine-tuning, we’re introducing a new JavaScript framework for small and large applications.

## What is SeqFlow?

SeqFlow is another JavaScript framework, but it’s not just another JavaScript framework: it’s a fresh approach to crafting maintainable applications. SeqFlow provides the tools you need without the bloat you don’t.

SeqFlow is a modern JavaScript framework built with simple reading and predictability in mind. It’s designed to help you build applications without cognitive overload.

SeqFlow is easy to use: a framework that works with you, not against you. Its API is clean and easy to understand, making it a joy to work with. With SeqFlow, you can focus on building your application, not fighting your framework.

SeqFlow is a future-ready framework seamlessly integrating with modern paradigms: async/await is enabled by default!

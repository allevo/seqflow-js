In this last part of the tutorial, we will cover how to test our SeqFlow application.

This tutorial taught us how to create a simple application using SeqFlow. We have covered the following topics:

- How to create a new SeqFlow application.
- How to fetch data from an API and manage the state of the application.
- How to create a new component.
- How to configure the application.
- How to test the application.
- How to create a domain.

Any comments or suggestions are really appreciated. Feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/allevo/seqflow-js/issues).
